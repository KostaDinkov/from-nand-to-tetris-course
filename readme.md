# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles:

## From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)

*This repository contains notes and solutions for the Coursera edition of the course.
The folder structure is based on the course projects by week.*

The Nand to Tetris course takes you on a self-paced fascinating voyage of discovery in which you will go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program that you fancy. In the process of building this computer you will become familiar with many important hardware abstractions, and you will implement them, hands on. But most of all, you will enjoy the tremendous thrill of building a complex and useful system from the ground up.

The course homework consists of a series 6 projects:

**Project 1:** Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more

**Project 2:** Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

**Project 3:** Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)

**Project 4:** Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs

**Project 5:** Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4

**Project 6:** Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
